# Coursera - Machine Learning - Week 11 (Conclusion)

1. Supervised Learning
	- Linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, SVMs.
	- For problems with labeled data.
2. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
	- K-means clustering, principal components analysis, anomaly detection.
	- For unlabeled data (although anomaly detection can also use labeled data)
3. Special Applications
	- Recommender systems
	- Large scale machine learning
	- Sliding windows for Photo OCR
	- Parallelizable Algorithms
4. Advice on building ML Systems
	- Bias variance
	- Regularization
	- Deciding what to work on next (ceiling analysis)
		- Evaluation of learning algorithms
		- Learning curves
		- Error Analysis
