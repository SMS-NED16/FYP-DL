# FYP-DL: Applications of Neural Networks for Anomalous Consumer Energy Consumption Detection

Code for tutorials, tests, and experimentation done as part of a Deep Learning-based undergraduate Final Year Project at the department of Electrical Engineering, NEDUET.

## Project Summary
Using supervised deep learning to systematically create, test, and optimise neural networks for detecting anomalous energy consumption patterns in smart meter data. Training using a labeled dataset published by the State Grid Corporation of China which spans 13 months of daily kWh smart meter measurements of ~42k residential consumers.

More details are in the [Project Proposal](./Proposals/fyp-proposal-gh.pdf).

## Group Members
All group members are final year undergraduates from Section D, Batch 2016-17 at the Department of Electrical Engineering, NEDUET.
